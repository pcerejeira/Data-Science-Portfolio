# Task 1

Covered mainly:
- Passing data Frontend -> Backend
- Database Queries / Population scripts

Languages used:
- SQL
- JavaScript

## Goal
As a member of the Addvolt development team, I was responsible for implementing a feature that allowed for the efficient storage of capacity and power values for our powerpack products in our database. This involved generating and handling database migrations, creating a logic in the frontend to extract these values from the commercial designation, which characterizes each powerpack, and passing them to the API for storage. Additionally, I also created SQL scripts to populate the capacity and power values for older products in the system. With the successful implementation of this feature, new products will automatically have their capacity and power values populated in real-time.

### Note:
This task was a regular Sprint assignment, as a result of the Scrum process, and the definition of done was met upon the successful implementation of columns for "capacity" and "power" for all powerpack products and their population using the commercial designation and the SQL scripts.
