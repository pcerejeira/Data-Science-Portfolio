# Healthcare Project: Predicting Hospital Readmissions

## Context

The objective of this project is to develop classification models for predicting hospital readmissions. Hospital readmissions are a critical concern in healthcare, impacting both patient outcomes and healthcare costs. By accurately predicting readmissions, healthcare providers can implement preventive measures and tailor post-discharge care to reduce readmission rates and improve patient care.

## Analysis Approach

The analysis involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection:** Raw data containing patient demographics, medical history, and discharge information is retrieved from healthcare databases.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** The fetched data is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.

3. **Model Development:** Classification models are developed using machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. The primary model predicts whether a patient will be readmitted within 30 days of discharge, while a secondary model classifies patients into categories based on the timeframe of readmission.

4. **Model Evaluation:** The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation techniques are employed to ensure robustness and generalizability.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Solution

The solution involves developing Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks to implement the analysis approach described above. These scripts utilize various libraries and modules, including Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for model development, and Matplotlib for visualization.

The developed models provide valuable insights for healthcare providers to identify patients at risk of readmission and tailor interventions accordingly. By leveraging predictive analytics, healthcare organizations can optimize resource allocation, reduce healthcare costs, and improve patient outcomes.

Please note that the code provided serves as a demonstration and may require adjustments for specific healthcare environments and datasets.
