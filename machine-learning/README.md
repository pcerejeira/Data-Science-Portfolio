Welcome to the Machine Learning section of my Portfolio!

Machine Learning is a field that has always intrigued me, and I am dedicated to continually expanding my expertise and experience within it.

Within this section, you'll find a variety of projects that showcase my journey through the realm of Machine Learning. These projects may include academic endeavors, reflecting the focus of my Master's degree on this area of study.

Join me as I explore the world of Machine Learning and its diverse applications.
