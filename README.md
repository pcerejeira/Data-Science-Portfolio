# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! Here, I invite you to explore a collection of projects that reflect my expertise, capabilities, and the impactful work I have been involved in over the years.

## Introduction

In this portfolio, I aim to showcase not only complex, full-scale projects but also my ability to tackle real-world problems and provide innovative solutions. While much of the content presented here was implemented within the operational stack of the companies I have worked with, I am unable to showcase everything in a working state. However, I believe that by sharing the problem contexts, snippets of the implemented solutions, and the achieved results, you will gain valuable insights into my skills and potential contributions.

## AWS Projects

In this section, I showcase projects related to AWS, highlighting my experience with cloud computing, data storage, and automation using AWS services. One example project could be fetching files from a client server using SFTP and saving them to AWS S3 using Python libraries.

## Frontend and UX Projects

Here, I present projects focused on frontend development and user experience. While not purely data science, these projects demonstrate my ability to create intuitive user interfaces and enhance user interactions. Examples may include React projects or other frontend technologies I have worked with.

## Database Management and Optimization

In this section, I highlight my expertise in database management and optimization. I showcase projects where I have fetched, cleaned, and created new data, performed database migrations, and optimized performance. Examples can cover data cleaning, resampling variables, studying database keys, and more.

## Library Upgrades and Security

Here, I showcase projects related to upgrading libraries and reviewing vulnerabilities in repositories. This demonstrates my commitment to keeping projects up to date and ensuring their security.

## Metabase - Business Intelligence

In this section, I present examples of my work with Metabase, a business intelligence platform. Although not coding-intensive, I demonstrate my expertise in SQL queries, data analysis, and presenting insights through visualizations and reports.

## Directed Data Analysis

Here, I showcase projects where I conducted data analysis based on requests from coworkers or specific business needs. Examples can include custom vehicle analysis, analysis of stops and charging locations for investment decisions, and analysis of unusual variations in given variables.

## State of Health and Battery Health Metrics

In this section, I present a project where I created variables, equations, and frontend plots to estimate the state of health of batteries and display various health metrics. This showcases my expertise in analyzing and interpreting battery data.

## Grafana

Grafana is an open-source visualization and analytics software. It provides tools to turn time-series database (TSDB) data into beautiful graphs and visualizations. In this section, I demonstrate projects where I have utilized Grafana to visualize and explore data stored in various databases. I leverage Grafana's capabilities to present compelling visual representations of data insights.

## MLU Emulator

Here, I showcase a project where I developed an MLU (Machine Learning Unit) emulator that can simulate streams running on a specific protocol. This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement systems for testing and evaluation purposes.

## Languages and Tools

Throughout my projects, I have worked with a diverse set of languages and tools. Some of the key ones include:

- Python
- SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- DBeaver
- Tableau
- Docker
- C++
- React

These are just a few examples, and my skill set extends beyond these languages and tools. I am constantly learning and exploring new technologies to stay at the forefront of the data science field.
