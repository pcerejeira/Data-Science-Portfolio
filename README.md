# Data-Analytics-Projects:
This repository was made with the aim of showing some of the projects I've been involved in, as well as the tools used and the thought process behind the solutions.

## Project 1

Covered mainly:
- Database Queries (1.5T size)
- External API
- Csv/Excel
- Json
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

Languages used:
- SQL
- Python

### Goal
The objective of this project was to cross the temperature of the batteries of a vehicle (provided by Addvolt), with the ambient temperature in the place where it circulated.

Ideally, I would be able to prove that the ambient temperature, even when reaching extremes (for example in the summer/winter and in places like Mexico or Nordic Countries), did not affect the efficiency of the batteries (since their temperature maintained regular/stable values).

#### Note:
For the given examples, a random data sample was generated, as company data cannot be shared.

## Project 2

Covered mainly:
- Pandas
- Csv/Excel

Languages used:
- SQL
- Python

### Goal
The goal of this project was to identify the locations (coordinates) where our clients were stopping their vehicles more often, in order to provide them with new electric charging points.

#### Note:
This analysis was asked directly by Addvolt's CEO and required simple data querying, cleaning, aggregation and manipulation.
