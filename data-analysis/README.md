# Data Analysis and Insights

Welcome to the Data Analysis and Insights section of my Portfolio! In this section, I will showcase a variety of data analysis projects where I have explored diverse datasets, performed statistical analysis, and derived valuable insights.

I believe that data analysis is not limited to specific domains or predefined objectives. Therefore, in this section, you will find a range of projects with different contexts, objectives, approaches, and results.

Please note that while some projects may include code snippets or visualizations, not all projects will have extensive code provided. In cases where integration with operational stacks is involved, the code shown here may not be runnable due to dependencies on specific infrastructure or data sources.

## Projects Showcased

1. [Project 1](./project1): Analyze the relationship between battery temperature and ambient conditions in vehicle operations to evaluate the impact of extreme temperatures on battery efficiency.

2. [Project 2](./project2): Evaluate the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of building new EV Charging locations based on the analysis of vehicle stop locations and their impact on client's fleet operations.

3. [Project 3](./project3): In Project 3, I addressed a critical concern raised by one of Addvolt's founders regarding significant fluctuations in generator current within a short timeframe. The aim was to identify these instances and prepare a comprehensive presentation for sharing with our partners and stakeholders. This project showcased our commitment to data-driven problem-solving and actionable insights.

4. [Project 4](./project4): In this Project, I tackled an emerging challenge identified by our team leader surrounding the delays observed in our Custom Plot functionality. These lags, suspected to be induced by middlewares like "rate limiter" and "slowdown", were impacting user experience significantly. By reviewing and analyzing the API's performance over a specified period, we sought to pinpoint the causes and brainstorm potential solutions. This project exemplified our dedication to optimizing user interactions and ensuring seamless platform performance.


I want to emphasize that in this section, I aim to showcase the diverse aspects of data analysis, including projects where the results may not be as visually appealing but still hold significant value. Data analysis is not just about beautiful visualizations but also about uncovering insights and making informed decisions based on the data.
