## Security, Vulnerability & Testing

Welcome to the Security, Vulnerability & Testing section of my Data Science Portfolio! In this section, I will share my experience in conducting security assessments, identifying vulnerabilities, and implementing measures to enhance data security.

Data security is crucial in today's digital landscape, and I have worked extensively to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Through security assessments, I have identified vulnerabilities and implemented robust security measures to protect sensitive information.

Additionally, I believe that comprehensive testing is an essential part of code maintainability and security. In this section, you will also find examples of testing in various languages, including JavaScript and Python. These testing examples showcase my commitment to delivering reliable and secure software systems.
