## AWS Projects

Welcome to the AWS Projects section of my Data Science Portfolio! In this section, I will showcase tasks and projects where I have actively utilized AWS services to achieve specific goals.

While AWS (Amazon Web Services) may not be directly connected to coding and pure data, it is extensively used across companies to build scalable and robust infrastructure, store and process data, and deploy applications. As such, showcasing my knowledge and experience with AWS is valuable in demonstrating my capabilities beyond coding and pure data analysis.

Please note that the projects showcased in this section represent a subset of my overall AWS capabilities. Due to the diverse nature of AWS services, it is not feasible to provide an exhaustive representation of all AWS skills. However, the projects presented here will provide insights into my abilities to leverage AWS services effectively.
