## Goal
The objective of this project was to cross the temperature of the batteries of a vehicle (provided by Addvolt), with the ambient temperature in the place where it circulated.

Ideally, I would be able to prove that the ambient temperature, even when reaching extremes (for example in the summer/winter and in places like Mexico or Nordic Countries), did not affect the efficiency of the batteries (since their temperature maintained regular/stable values).

### Note:
For the given examples, a random data sample was generated, as company data cannot be shared.
