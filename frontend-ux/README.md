## Frontend and UX Projects

Welcome to the Frontend and UX Projects section of my Data Science Portfolio! In this section, I will showcase projects and tasks related to frontend development and user experience (UX).

While frontend and UX may not be the primary focus of data science, they can prove useful in situations where a company or client desires to integrate, visualize, and present data on internal or external platforms.

### Projects showcased:

Please note that most of the development showcased in this section belongs to a larger platform. As a result, the snippets and problems presented here do not represent standalone projects but rather components or features within a larger system.
